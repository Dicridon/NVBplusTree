# B+ tree implemented using PMDK

A very simple B+ tree running on NVM implemented using PMDK. This B+ tree is derived from the DRAM B+ tree in my repo https://github.com/Dicridon/BPlusTreeInC
I have verified the correctness of the DRAM B+ tree, so perhaps this NVM B+ tree would just function correcly

For explanation of macros and interfaces I used, check pmem.io
